First it is important to describe the metric by which we are judging ‘popularity’. For this purpose I will be looking at the number of reviews per neighbourhood. This can potential measure the amount of people which stay in certain neighbourhoods although it doesn’t record how the customer felt about the neighbourhood or if other customers just aren’t submitting reviews. According to the query below, Mission, Western Addition, and Castro/Upper Market are the three most popular neighbourhoods.
